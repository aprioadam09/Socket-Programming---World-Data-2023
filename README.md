This project was part of my Data Communications course, where I developed a Python socket programming application featuring a server that provides country data and a client that requests this data.

Key Features: Server-client architecture utilizing sockets, Server supplies general or detailed information about countries based on client requests, and Implemented data parsing, error handling, and data saving.

This project demonstrates my skills in socket programming, data handling, and client-server communication.
